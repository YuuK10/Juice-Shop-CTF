OWASP Juice Shop is probably the most modern and sophisticated insecure web application! It can be used in security
trainings, awareness demos, CTFs and as a guinea pig for security tools! Juice Shop encompasses vulnerabilities from the
entire
[OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten) along with many other security flaws found in real-world
applications!

## Setup

### Gitpod 

1. Login to [gitpod.io](https://gitpod.io) and use <https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop/> to start a new workspace. If you want to spin up a forked repository, your URL needs to be adjusted accordingly.

2. After the Gitpod workspace is loaded, Gitpod tasks is still running to install `npm install`  and launch the website. Despite Gitpod showing your workspace state already as _Running_, you need to wait until the installation process is done, before the website becomes accessable. The _Open Preview Window (Internal Browser)_, will open automatically and refresh itself automatically when the server has started.

3. Your Juice Shop instance is now also available at `https://3000-<GITPOD_WORKSPACE_ID>.<GITPOD_HOSTING_ZONE>.gitpod.io`.
